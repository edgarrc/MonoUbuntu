MonoUbuntu
=========

A simple script to install Mono / Apache-mod-mono on a Ubuntu server. Ready for production use, so you can run your ASP.NET application (or console/gui app as well) on Linux.

This script will ask for an application name and apache will be configured to handle this specific application as ASP.NET, so it will not interfere if you plan to use apache with php or anything else.

### Usage

```shell
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgarrc/MonoUbuntu/master/install.sh)$"
```

The script will ask for an application name.

### Demonstration

- If you need a sample application to test your installation, you can download this compiled [Hello World] (https://github.com/edgarrc/MonoUbuntu/releases/download/hello/hello.zip) (with web forms)
