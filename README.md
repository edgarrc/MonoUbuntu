MonoUbuntu
=========

A simple script to install Mono / Apache-mod-mono (and other related stuff) on a Ubuntu server. Ready for production use, so you can run your ASP.NET application (or client as well) on Linux.

### Know issues

- For now, do not attemp to execute if you already have apache installed as it may corrupt your installation. This script is tested only on a clean/minimal installation of Ubuntu (the default option for most cloud servers).

### Usage

```shell
$ sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgarrc/MonoUbuntu/master/install.sh)$ "
```
